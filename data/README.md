# Data

## ðŸš€ Description

This directory contains the data which is needed for our project. You need to manually download "Sarcasm_Headlines_Dataset_v2.json" and put it here.[^1] 

The data splits are saved under [splits](./splits/). There are multiple folders for not-stemmed and stemmed data. Each split contains the number of top tokens used to generate the one-hot encodings. Some samples are uploaded in the git repository. For info about how to generate the split refer to [README](../src/README.md).
